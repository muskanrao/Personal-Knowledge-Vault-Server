# Personal-Knowledge-Vault-Server

This repository contains the backend for Personal Vault, a secure knowledge management API that allows users to store and manage their personal notes, links, snippets, and ideas in one place.

The server is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB and follows a clean, controller-based architecture. It provides JWT-based authentication and user-scoped APIs so that every user can access only their own data.
